# RecursionWarmups
Various applications that use recursion to accomplish tasks submitted as part of Stanford's Programming Abstractions class.

The warmup problems include:
- finding the weight supported by a specific person in a given human pyramid
- coloring in existing polygons with a user-inputted color
- finding a random solution to a game of Marble Solitaire
- determining if a solution exists to a game of Dominosa

All problems are implemented in recursionproblems.cpp.

Full spec is included in the repository under 'Assignment_03_Recursion.pdf' on pages 1-9.
